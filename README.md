# Computer-Vision
Count the number of items in the given freezer images.
This project is a computer vision item counter that counts the number of items in given freezer images. It detects and locates all the compartments of the refrigerator using computer vision techniques and then counts the items. The user inputs the path to the image, and the program counts and displays the information about the number of items in the image. The frontend was created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, while the backend was developed using Python.
